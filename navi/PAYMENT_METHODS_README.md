  id              Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId          Int
  brand           String   // Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, etc.
  logo            String?  // URL to payment method logo

  paymentMethod   String   // 'card', 'paypal', 'bank'
  status          String   @default("active") // 'active', 'expired', 'suspended'
  lastUsed        DateTime?
  securityFeatures String[] // Array of security features
  bankName        String?  // For bank accounts

- `src/lib/payment-methods.ts` - Payment method service and helpers
- `src/app/components/CardDetailsModal.tsx` - Card details modal component
- `prisma/seed-payment-methods.ts` - Database seeding script

### Modified Files

## Setup Instructions

1. **Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   npx prisma generate

   ```bash
   npx tsx prisma/seed-payment-methods.ts

## Security Considerations

- **CVV Storage**: Currently stored in plain text - should be encrypted in production
- **Card Numbers**: Only masked versions are stored
- **API Security**: Add authentication middleware to protect API endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Add comprehensive validation for all payment method data
- **PCI Compliance**: Ensure compliance with PCI DSS standards for production use

2. **Encryption**: Implement proper encryption for sensitive data
3. **Webhooks**: Add webhook support for payment status updates
4. **Analytics**: Track payment method usage and preferences
5. **Multi-currency**: Support for different currencies
